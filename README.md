# <h1 align="center">VENTIGO</h1>

## Background Info
Whenever talking about mental health and finding healthy outlets, one of the first suggestions tends to revolve around journaling, but it's hard to keep up and maintain if you're on the go and don't carry it around with you. Or sometimes after a long day at work, maybe a bad fight with a friend happened, the urge to word vomit everything that's been bothering you and boiling up can bring  up a lot of conflicted emotions, especially about who to turn to and vent with no fear of being judged or contested. That's the purpose of Ventigo: somewhere to type away whatever you're going through at the moment and want to expel from your system to help yourself and those around you. Make it personal, or not, and feel accepted in a little forum space that might just relate to what you have to say, and not feel so alone in frustration. A simpler MERN-stack app to get things off your chest.

### Next Steps:

After gaining more experience working with SPAs and React, I'd like to flesh out this app by allowing users to view a single entry thru a link, where they will have the ability to relate(like), and comment. 
In terms of UI, I think this app has a lot of potential for having a clean minimalistic style that strays away from most forum-based apps. Organizing the entries by the date they were posted, and a more efficient way to reload the front page after an entry has been added at a modern pace with CSS manipulation to have the entries render on the page cleanly.
It would also really enhance the user experience if they were able to update their bio after signing up, and changing it to a status bar where they can share with other users how they're feeling when visiting their page.
